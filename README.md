# Practicals

### Git and Github
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows developers to track changes in their code over time. Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts, enables branching and merging for parallel development, and provides a complete history of changes made to the codebase.
GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git that provides hosting for software development and collaboration using Git. It was launched in 2008 and has since become one of the most popular platforms for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on open-source projects.
