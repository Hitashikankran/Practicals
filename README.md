### Git and Github
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows developers to track changes in their code over time.  Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts, enables branching and merging for parallel development, and provides a complete history of changes made to the codebase.
GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git that provides hosting for software development and collaboration using Git. It was launched in 2008 and has since become one of the most popular platforms for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on open-source projects.

### Aglie
Agile is a project management and product development approach that prioritizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It emphasizes iterative and incremental development, adaptability to changing requirements, and continuous feedback throughout the development process. Agile methodologies aim to deliver high-quality, working software in a more efficient and responsive manner compared to traditional project management approaches.

### DAA
The Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) is a field of study within computer science that focuses on the development, design, and analysis of efficient algorithms for solving computational problems. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or sets of rules for performing a specific task or solving a particular problem. The study of algorithms involves understanding their properties, efficiency, correctness, and practical applicability.
